# llm-instruct-cloud-deploy

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of building, fine-tuning, and deploying a state-of-the-art instruction-following large language model (LLM) using modern MLOps practices. It is designed for technical rigor and portfolio impact, showcasing hands-on implementation, robust documentation, and production-ready deployment. The workflow enables you to train locally and deploy anywhere, highlighting advanced skills in AI engineering, MLOps, and cloud automation.

## Model Implementation & Performance

- **Efficient Local Fine-Tuning:**  
  Fine-tuned Llama-2 7B model on high-quality instruction datasets (Alpaca, Self-Instruct) using consumer-grade GPUs and memory-efficient quantization (QLoRA 4-bit).

- **End-to-End MLOps Pipeline:**  
  Implemented reproducible data versioning (DVC), experiment tracking (MLflow/wandb), and workflow orchestration (Makefile/Prefect).

- **Model Registry & Documentation:**  
  Versioned and published trained models on Hugging Face Hub with detailed model cards and evaluation metrics.

- **Production-Ready Cloud Serving:**  
  Built a fully automated, one-click deployment system for inference and a Streamlit web UI, deployable on user-owned AWS or GCP accounts using cloud-native infrastructure and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Helm, Kubernetes).

- **Comprehensive Documentation:**  
  Provided step-by-step guides, configuration files, and teardown instructions for both local and cloud environments.

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Local Fine-Tuning & Testing

- Versioned and preprocessed instruction datasets with DVC.
- Downloaded and quantized Llama-2 7B to enable training on 10GB VRAM GPUs.
- Fine-tuned models using Axolotl/Unsloth, tracked experiments in MLflow/wandb.
- Evaluated and tested models locally using llama.cpp and Ollama for real-world prompts.

### 2. Model Versioning & Sharing

- Packaged and documented models with model cards and evaluation results.
- Published models to Hugging Face Hub with version tags for reproducibility and collaboration.

### 3. Automated Cloud Deployment

- Containerized both the inference backend and Streamlit UI.
- Developed Terraform modules for provisioning EKS (AWS) and GKE (GCP) clusters, networking, and storage.
- Created Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts for seamless deployment.
- Integrated cloud-native monitoring and provided easy teardown scripts.
- Enabled one-click deployment from the GitHub README, empowering users to launch their own scalable inference endpoints and web UIs on their cloud accounts.
