# llm-instruct-cloud-deploy

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of building, fine-tuning, and deploying a state-of-the-art instruction-following large language model (LLM) using modern MLOps practices. It is designed for technical rigor and portfolio impact, showcasing hands-on implementation, robust documentation, and production-ready deployment. The workflow enables you to train locally and deploy anywhere, highlighting advanced skills in AI engineering, MLOps, and cloud automation.

## Model Implementation & Performance

- **Efficient Local Fine-Tuning:**  
  Fine-tuned Llama-2 7B models on high-quality instruction datasets (Alpaca, Self-Instruct) using consumer-grade GPUs and memory-efficient quantization (QLoRA 4-bit).

- **End-to-End MLOps Pipeline:**  
  Implemented reproducible data versioning (DVC), experiment tracking (MLflow/wandb), and workflow orchestration (Makefile/Prefect).

- **Model Registry & Documentation:**  
  Versioned and published trained models on Hugging Face Hub with detailed model cards and evaluation metrics.

- **Production-Ready Cloud Serving:**  
  Built a fully automated, one-click deployment system for inference and a Streamlit web UI, deployable on user-owned AWS or GCP accounts using cloud-native infrastructure and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Helm, Kubernetes).

- **Comprehensive Documentation:**  
  Provided step-by-step guides, configuration files, and teardown instructions for both local and cloud environments.

### Benchmarks

### Key Accomplishments

- Instruction-tuned LLMs that outperform base models on diverse user prompts and tasks.
- Reproducible research workflow with complete experiment and data lineage.
- Model versioning and sharing via Hugging Face, enabling easy collaboration and deployment.
- Cloud-agnostic, scalable inference with a user-friendly Streamlit interface.
- Resume-ready, production-grade codebase demonstrating advanced MLOps, cloud, and AI engineering skills.

### Hugging Face Model Card

The fine-tuned models are versioned and published on Hugging Face Hub with detailed model cards and evaluation metrics, enabling easy collaboration and reproducibility.

## One-Click Cloud Deployment

**Deploy to your own cloud account with a single click:**

| Cloud Provider | One-Click Deploy |
|----------------|------------------|
| **AWS**        | [![Deploy on AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-AWS-blue?logo=amazon-aws)](https://github.com/llm-instruct-cloud-deploy/actions/workflows/deploy-aws.yml) |
| **GCP**        | [![Deploy on GCP](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-GCP-orange?logo=google-cloud)](https://github.com/llm-instruct-cloud-deploy/actions/workflows/deploy-gcp.yml) |

Deployments are fully automated. All resources are provisioned in your account; you retain full control and responsibility for costs.
